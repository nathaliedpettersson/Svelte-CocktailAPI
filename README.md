## Svelte app in TypeScript using TheCocktailDB's open API 

This project was developed as a fun practice and introduction to fetching API calls in a Svelte app. 
It's using `+.server.ts` to fetch data and later on passing it to `+page.ts` so that `+page.svelte` can render the random cocktail on the site.
